1. What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to create a repository to so git has access to your working folder.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you to upload files individually to it from your working directory which are then grouped together and can be committed together to the repository.
